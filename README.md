## What are Roblox Item Codes?

Roblox item codes are special alphanumeric strings that allow players to unlock exclusive items for their avatars, including clothing, accessories, hats, and more. These codes can be redeemed for free items or sometimes even paid items, depending on the nature of the code. Players use Roblox item codes to enhance their avatar’s look or gain other advantages within the game.
